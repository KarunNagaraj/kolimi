<h2>Why This Situation Hits So Hard</h2>

<p>
  The emotional reaction isn’t about the fee itself.
  It’s about what the situation represents.
</p>

<h3>1. It’s not a rule break — it’s a precedent</h3>
<p>
  When small, unannounced actions go unchallenged, they quietly set a standard.
  They teach what is acceptable.
  For someone who values integrity and process, this feels dangerous — not trivial.
</p>

<h3>2. Silence feels like complicity</h3>
<p>
  When others stay quiet because they are busy or indifferent, it can feel invalidating.
  Even without intent, the silence sends a message:
  <em>this doesn’t matter enough to question</em>.
</p>

<p>
  That can hurt more than the original lack of transparency.
</p>

<h3>3. You’re forced into an impossible position</h3>
<p>
  Speak up, and risk being labeled difficult or overly sensitive.
  Stay quiet, and feel like you’re betraying your own values.
</p>

<p>
  That internal conflict is exhausting —
  and it’s a major source of the anger that follows.
